## The Flow
### Standard User Flow
1. A user comes in, enters his email address in his own form
1. User submits the form to `https://domain.com/email@example.com`
1. When the email address is not associated with the Page/Domain
  1. An intermediate page will show with a prompt to enter an optional slack hook + captcha
  1. An email is sent to confirm along with an option to enter the slack url
  1. The email link confirms for the Page, Slack Hook, form ID
1. The user is redirect back to the same page if \_next is not set. \_next is limited to the same proto+FQDN
1. Once the confirmation is made, an email is sent to the user with the submitted form
1. When a user's customer comes in and submits the form, he gets redirected to \_next page or referral page
